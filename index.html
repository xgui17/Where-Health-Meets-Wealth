            &emsp;
            The field of global health is multifaceted, influenced by a wide range of factors that extend 
        beyond healthcare services. Socioeconomic determinants play a pivotal role in shaping health 
        outcomes, and understanding these relationships is crucial for designing effective policies, 
        implementing necessary interventions, and improving resource allocation strategies. 
        <br><br>
            &emsp;
            &emsp;    
            Throughout this project, you will be guided through a narrative journey that explore the 
        impact of Social Determinants of Health (SDoH), identify regional disparities, and 
        investigate the complex dynamics that influence health outcomes worldwide.

            Figure 1 depicts the relationship between average years that people aged 25+ spend in 
            formal education and average infant mortality rates for over 180 countries, and it 
            reveals a negative correlation. Developed countries predominantly occupy the end with 
            higher levels of average schooling and lower infant mortality rates, while developing 
            countries are clustered at the other end. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;
            &emsp; 
            This visualization emphasizes that developed countries tend to invest more in education 
            systems and support more educational opportunities. It also underscores the significance 
            of education as a Social Determinant of Health in improving health outcomes of infants 
            and mitigating risks to newborns. This insight may help policy makers to prioritize 
            educational investments and programs that may contribute to improved infant health 
            and overall population well-being.

            The choropleth map (Figure 2) displays the average vaccination rates among 1-year-olds 
            for several vaccines, including Hepatitis B (HepB3), Measles (MCV1), Polio (Pol3), and 
            Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3). The lighter coloration observed in 
            African countries indicates lower vaccine coverage, which may reflect weaker healthcare 
            systems and insufficient health funding. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;
            &emsp; 
            This visualization draws attention to the disparities in access to vaccinations and 
            more broadly to basic healthcare services. It highlights the urgent need for targeted 
            interventions, improved healthcare infrastructure, and increased funding in regions 
            with lower vaccination coverage. Addressing these gaps can lead to higher immunization 
            rates, disease prevention, and enhanced overall health outcomes.

            Figure 3 illustrates the flow of Development Assistance for Health (DAH) funding between 
            different regions from 1990 to 2021. The width of the links represents the amount of 
            funding flow, while the size of the nodes corresponds to the average GDP per capita of 
            the region. Major donors, such as North America and the EU, are characterized by higher 
            GDP per capita and exhibit significant contributions to DAH funding, while major recipients 
            like Asia and Africa tend to have lower GDP per capita and received much more DAH 
            fundings than donated.

            This visualization highlights the economic disparities and regional imbalances in 
            healthcare financing. Policymakers can leverage this information to promote equitable 
            distribution of DAH funding, encourage collaboration among regions, and foster 
            sustainable investments in healthcare infrastructure. By addressing funding gaps and 
            promoting fair resource allocation, global health inequities can be addressed 
            more effectively.

            Dear audience,
            <br><br>
            &emsp;
            &emsp;
            Global health inequity has persistently remained a critical global challenge, primarily 
            due to deep-rooted structural disparities. By engaging with these visualizations and 
            analyzing the impacts of multiple Social Determinants of Health (SDoH) on health 
            outcomes, we hope to foster your recognition of the dire need to find solutions and 
            drive positive changes to improve the current status quo.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;
            &emsp;
            It is within our collective power to ignite changes and strive for a future in which 
            everyone has an equal opportunity to lead a healthy life. Take action, raise your voice, 
            and do your best to help improve the lives of those affected by health disparities.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;
            &emsp;
            Thank you for joining me on this journey and let us inspire one another to make a 
            meaningful impact on the path toward global health equity.

            The data sources this project include <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lashagoch/life-expectancy-who-updated">Kaggle</a>, 
            <a href="https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/development-assistance-health-database-1990-2021">IHME</a>
            (Institution for Health Metrics and Evaluation), and 
            <a href="https://geojson-maps.ash.ms/">geojson-maps</a>. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;
            &emsp;
            The first dataset contains relevant health, economic and demographic information. There 
            are multiple rows for each country, which are data collected in different years. Only 
            the most recent data are kept. An average infant vaccination rate is obatined by 
            calculating the mean of four attributes which are the average infant vaccine coverage 
            rates of Hepatitis B (HepB3), Measles (MCV1), Polio (Pol3), and Diphtheria tetanus 
            toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) respectively. 3-digit ISO code are merged to the dataset 
            for mapping convenience, and necessary string replacements are made to clean up typos 
            and unify country or dependency name. Attributes that are not needed in this project 
            are dropped. Figure 1 and 2 utilized information from this dataset. The regional average 
            GDP in figure 3 is also obtained from this dataset.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;
            &emsp;
            The second dataset contains information on Development Assistance for Health (DAH) 
            fundings from 1990 to 2021. Fundings with unknown donor or recipient country, which is 
            denoted by ‚ÄúUnallocated/Unspecified‚Äù, are dropped. Fundings used for administration purposes or 
            meant for global use are also dropped. Necessary string replacements are made to clean 
            up typos and unify country or dependency name. Regional information are added to the 
            dataset in alignment to the previous dataset. The remaining fundings are then aggregated 
            by region to calculate total donated and received fundings. Figure 3 utilized this dataset. 
            <br><br>
            &emsp;
            &emsp;
            The third dataset is a json file containing demographical information of the globe. It 
            is used in figure 2 together with the first dataset with correspondence on the ISO code.
